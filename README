Code used for my Bachelors' Thesis: Automatic Locality-friendly Array
Interface Extension of Numerical Functions through C++ Metaprogramming

The thesis document itself can be found at:

This benchmark program and collection of scripts tests different options
of implementing strided and blockstrided access (see thesis) to arrays
for numerical applications and compares the performance for different
functions, compilers and compiler optimizations.  Plots are generated
for easy comparison.

1. Software used
================

see file ./versions.txt


2. Quickstart
=============

to generate everything:
./start-here.sh


3. Files and directories
========================

directories:
./comparison       : a place to store one-page comparisons for each function
./bin              : contains compiled benchmarks
./output           : contains raw output
./output-archive   : contains the results referred to in the thesis
./output_filtered  : contains output filtered by function and access
./output_processed : contains filtered output prepared for gnuplot
./plots            : contains generated plots
./ratios           : contains results of ./ratios?.sh
./src              : source code of benchmark

scripts:
./compare.sh       : create side by side view of plots for each function
./filter_output.sh : filter data in ./output
./make.sh          : compile benchmark with different compilers and flags
./plot.sh          : process filtered output and plot
./ratios.sh        : compute performance ratios (baseline linear)
./ratios2.sh        : compute performance ratios (baseline manual)
./run.sh           : run benchmarks and collect output
./start-here.sh    : run all scripts in the correct order


4. Benchmark details
====================

The access methods are applied to input and (where applicable) output,
using the same configuration.
The result of functions returning a single value are added to a container
with O(1) for appending (<forward_list>) to prevent the compiler from
optimizing away the calculation.
A backup of the randomized input is made for functions that overwrite it,
and restored afterwards.
A separate benchmark binary is created for each function tested.
Before each run, the input array is filled with random values.
Multiple runs are supported with parameter -n <runs>.

Tested parameters are:
strided access: stride 2, 4, 8
blockstrided access: stride 4 + block size 2, stride 8 + block size 4
The "linear" function is included as a (rough) comparison with linear
access of the same input size as the equivalent strided/blockstrided 
access; it is of the same effective size, but not the same input.
When using SSE, the checks in alignment.h are used to decide if multiple
values can be loaded and stored at the same time.

Tested variants are:
- original function with copying of input and output (where applicable)
- striding implemented in C function body
- blockstriding implemented in C function body
- C++ version with minimal changes, using tynename template
Optional, not everywhere: enable using -DCLASS compiler flag (see make.sh)
- (C++ version using a class hierarchy and virtual functions)
(this was tested at the beginning of my work, as a comparison)

functions in src/functions, mostly adapted from b.hess:
- contrast       : normalize range of values in an image
- contrast_sse   : contrast making use of SSE (double precision)
- copy_dummy     : make a copy of the array
- dft_512        : small dft (discrete fourier transform) with input size 1024
- dft_1048576    : dft with input size 2097152
- filter         : generic 2d convolution with a kernel of size 3x3
- fir            : simple FIR filter that computes the average of index i and i+1
- fir_sse_double : like fir, using SSE double precision operations
- fir_sse_float  :  like fir, using SSE single precision operations
- quicksort      : recursive in-place sorting
- rec_mergesort  : recursive mergesort, needs a temporary array.
                   (does not overwrite input, output is to a third array)
- rec_reduce     : recursive sum reduction of an array
- reduce         : sum reduction of an array
- scan           : prefix sum of a vector
- sse_mvm        : matrix vector multiplication: y = x * M + y, 2x2


5. Plot details
===============

The plot show clustered bars for each input size.
Around the top of the bar an error range is shown. The boundaries are computed as suggested in
http://users.elis.ugent.be/~leeckhou/papers/oopsla07-stat.pdf, Section 3.2.2,
with a confidence level of 95%, assuming a t-distribution.


6. Remarks
==========

In quicksort.cpp, the same memcpy of the input array is made in each test
to avoid overwriting the input.
The function test code makes heavy use of macros in src/macros.h
to avoid rewriting much of the test.

Necessary changes for enhanced version of original functions:
The iterator/class versions of iterative functions are very easy to write:
just prepend the original function with a template and adjust the
parameter list. If pointer arithmetic is to be used, the parameter must not
be a reference.
Recursive functions need a little more work: function names have to be replaced.


7. Bugs
=======

- clang SSE support (in my setup) does not include _mm_set_pd1, only _mm_set_pd


8. License
